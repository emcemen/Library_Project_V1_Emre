****In this document changed user stories information stored****

1-User story 3 was created  like
    Given I login as a librarian
    When I navigate to "Books" page
    And I take all book categories in UI
    And I execute query to get book categories
    Then verify book categories must match book_categories table from db

    instead of using (I) we can use same as before in US2 (user) because repeated actions will be coded and
    the code will be not clean so if something is changed it will be placed and stored in that document
    for information. US3 ALL (I) CHANGED TO (user)
